# mouse-operations
Mouse Operations using finger tracking is an interactive mouse operation system that allows users to surf their computers without having to use a mouse. This application converts hand movements to cursor movements using OpenCV libraries and performs the functions of a mouse. Each mouse operation like right click, left click, select and drop is assigned a gesture that implements the operation. The appplication is designed to be used at public setups like airports that are used by many people, to reduce the risk of germ spread by contact with infected devices and can also be used in many home appliances like television remote controllers and gaming applications.
